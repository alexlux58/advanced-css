## Credits

The resources and examples in this repository were created by Alex Lux. However, I would like to give credit to Jonas Schmedtmann for his exceptional teaching and inspiration that helped me learn and master advanced CSS concepts. His online course, "Advanced CSS and Sass," provided the foundation for many of the techniques and concepts covered in this repository.

I highly recommend Jonas Schmedtmann's courses and resources for anyone looking to improve their CSS and web development skills. You can find more information about his courses and resources at his website, [codingheroes.io](https://codingheroes.io/).

Thank you, Jonas, for your incredible work and dedication to teaching web development!
